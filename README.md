# Smart_Home_Automation_Arduino
This project presents the overall design of Home Automation System (HAS) with low cost and wireless system. This system is designed to assist and provide support in order to fulfill the needs of elderly and disabled in home. Also, the smart home concept in the system improves the standard living at home. . The switch mode and voice mode are used to control the home appliances. The main control system implements wireless technology to provide remote access from smart phone. The design remains the existing electrical switches and provides more safety control on the switches with low voltage activating method. The switches status is synchronized in all the control system whereby every user interface indicates the real time existing switches status. The system intended to control electrical appliances and devices in house with relatively low cost design, user-friendly interface and ease of installation.
